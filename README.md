# Public Transit for Public Lands

Identifying the best strategic public transportation options to and from national lands and waters from urban centers is an important aspect of understanding accessibility for underserved communities with limited access to private vehicles. This project will involve identifying and mapping optimal public transportation routes for select urban centers close to national lands and waters and meet certain criteria. This project will highlight locations that are within two hours from urban centers and provide easy access to facilities and select recreational opportunities (swimming, fishing, hiking, etc.) to differentiate them from locations that provide limited opportunities or are otherwise difficult to access without a private vehicle. Information from the Recreation Information Database and other data sources from the Department of Interior (DOI) and National Park Service will be utilized to complement this initiative. DOI's hope is that a complete travel itinerary can be developed (including public transportation and footpath maps) using the OpenStreetMap framework. To participate, add public transit routes to public lands using [this online form](http://bit.ly/doimaps).

## Getting Started

1. Select an urban place of interest.  This can be anywhere within the United States.  We suggest you select a place you're already familiar with. 
2. Using Google Maps, Bing Maps, OSM or any other online mapping tool you like, select a place to start a trip.  We suggest starting with an urban center (e.g. La Crosse, WI, a community center, local library or other public gathering place.  Mark this location on your map.
3. Next, look for public lands in and around this location that appear to be roughly 30 - 90 miles from your starting location (est. a 2 hr maximum one-way trip).  Once you've selected a site to visit, get travel directions via the selected tool, using public transportation as the mode of transportation.  Review the time estimate for your selection.  If the time estimate is longer than 2 hours each way, consider an alternative location to visit, or a community center closer to public lands.  Alternative method: start with a public land that appears to be within 30 - 60 miles of an urban center, and identify community centers within the travel radius.
4. Once you have a travel itinerary, submit it using the form above!  Return to step #1, and repeat!

Here are a few examples:

[Washington, D.C. to Piscataway Park](https://goo.gl/maps/dksysQbgY1k) (total travel time: 1 hr 29 minutes, by bus).
[Albuquerque, N.M. to Petroglyph National Monument](https://goo.gl/maps/YE1ytxM41iu) (total travel time: 41 mins, by bus and walking)
[Atlanta, GA to Whitewater Creek Trails](https://goo.gl/maps/EbCcpNnqDoq) (total travel time: 1 hr 5 min, 28 mins walking)
