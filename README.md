# Public Transit for Public Lands

Identifying the best strategic public transportation options to and from national lands and waters from urban centers is an important aspect of understanding accessibility for underserved communities with limited access to private vehicles. This project will involve identifying and mapping optimal public transportation routes for select urban centers close to national lands and waters and meet certain criteria. This project will highlight locations that are within two hours from urban centers and provide easy access to facilities and select recreational opportunities (swimming, fishing, hiking, etc.) to differentiate them from locations that provide limited opportunities or are otherwise difficult to access without a private vehicle. Information from the Recreation Information Database and other data sources from the Department of Interior (DOI) and National Park Service will be utilized to complement this initiative. DOI's hope is that a complete travel itinerary can be developed (including public transportation and footpath maps) using the OpenStreetMap framework. To participate, add public transit routes to public lands using [this online form](http://bit.ly/doimaps).
